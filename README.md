# Stock Analysis System

## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Original Goal
Build a real-time data processing pipeline using AWS Kinesis, DynamoDB, and Python to ingest, process, and store real-time data streams.

### 1.2 Refined Goal
To build an intelligent stock analysis system that leverages real-time and historical data to provide accurate stock price predictions, assisting investors in making informed decisions. The system automates data processing and analysis, utilizes advanced machine learning models for predictions, and ensures efficient storage and access to the results.

**Project Value Proposition:** Empower investors with more accurate investment decisions, reduce risk, and enhance investment returns.

        A[Stock API Data] -->|Pushes real-time stock data| B[Stream Data Storage];
        B -->|Triggers| C[Serverless Function A: Lambda];
        C -->|Calculates technical indicators & Invokes Prediction| D[Machine Learning Predict Model: SageMaker Endpoint];
        D -->|Returns prediction result| C;
        C -->|Writes processed data| F[No-SQL DB: DynamoDB];
        F -->|Queries data| G[Visualization: QuickSight];
        G -->|Displays predictions| G;
    end
